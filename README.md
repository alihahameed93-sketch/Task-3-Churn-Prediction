# Customer Churn Prediction

## 📌 Objective
This repository contains the solution for Task 3 of the Data Science & Analytics Internship
at DevelopersHub Corporation. The goal is to build a machine learning classifier to 
predict whether a bank customer will churn (leave the bank) based on historical customer data.

## 🧠 Approach
- Loaded the Churn Modelling dataset
- Removed unnecessary columns
- Encoded categorical variables (Gender, Geography)
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Trained a Random Forest classifier
- Evaluated model using accuracy and confusion matrix
- Analyzed feature importance

## 📊 Results
The Random Forest model achieved an accuracy of 86.7% on the test dataset.

## 📥 Files Included
- `Task-3-Churn-Prediction.ipynb` — Notebook with full analysis and code
- `README.md` — Project overview and instructions

## ▶️ How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Google Colab or Jupyter.
2. Upload or point to the dataset (`Churn_Modelling.csv`).
3. Run all cells from top to bottom.

## 🧾 Dataset
The dataset used is the Churn Modelling dataset containing bank customer information
such as age, credit score, geography, etc., with a label `Exited`.
